			<h3> A Few Personal Insights</h3>
		</center>
		<p> This is the game where quickscoping started to become a very big part of youtube as well as video games in general and this is also where I believe the Call of Duty series really cemented itself into the history books and will be a game that is instantly recognizeable when you think of the fps genre</p>
