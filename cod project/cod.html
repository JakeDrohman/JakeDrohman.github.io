					<h4>The coolest video game <strong>ever</strong>. okay, well <i>maybe</i> not. But its still a pretty great game. Here are a few of my favorites.</h4>
					<h3>My History with Call of Duty</h3>
					<p>I first started playing Call of Duty a long time ago after I got my first game console, a nintendo wii. The first game had horrible input lag and was not very user friendly. However, the game, at its core, had a very promising concept along with great gameplay and amazing graphics.</p>

					<p>Then I got an xbox 360 and that is when I knew this game would take a big chunk out of my time because it was such a great game. My fist game on xbox was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. This game was the next game in the "Modern Warfare" series. It boasted an incredible storyline as well as improved graphics and a very addicting multiplayer.</p>
